# Complexity-projet-Sorting-algorithm-
Sorting is one of the most classically studied families of algorithms, because they are
among the modules essential for the good running of more advanced algorithms. The
general principle of a sorting algorithm is to order (in ascending order for example)
the objects of a collection of data (values), according to a comparison criterion (key –
for us, values and keys are here confused: these are the elements of an array of
integers). We generally carry out sorting by using « in-place » approach: the sorted
values are stored in the same array as the initial values (which therefore becomes an
input-output parameter).
There are many sorting algorithms.

The objectives of this project are multiple:

• Put into practice and test some sorting algorithms;

• Study sorting algorithms and calculate their complexity;

• Confront theoretical complexity and evaluation of running cost;

• In order to study the real cost of the algorithms, you will test them on arrays of
  integers of increasing size n filled randomly. To be reliable, time measurement must
  be done several times (for example 5 times) for a given array size. It is up to you to
  choose the values of n that seem relevant to you. For each studied sort, you will draw
  a graph representing the running time as a function of n;
  
• Compare the different methods from a theoretical and experimental point of view.
